# Installing R 

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* [ ] Have base R installed on a computer
* [ ] Have Rstudio installed on their computer
* [ ] Install the tidyverse 
* [ ] Run commands in editor, notice that it shows in global environment 
* [ ] Execute tips script using library 
* [ ] Examine tips output in console 
* [ ] Change color of RStudio 
* [ ] Get R Markdown to work 

## Base R 


There is no online thing for R, need to run this on computer.
Luckly this is much easier to do with R than Python. 

Note you want to follow these steps!
Just because you have RStudio from conda, not going to always work.
Best to just do clean install. 

- R is programming language that just had its 20th birthday
- Currenlty on 4.0
- Grows quickly and most of it lives on CRAN
- Go to cran to get it 
- Follow on screen instructions to get package
- Mac will do the rest
- Once it's done, can verify it's on computer by going to command line
- type R
- but doing it like this is insane 
- so either x out of termanal or quit() then don't save workspace

## RStudio

- Many IDEs (define) are avalible for all coding
- The one that most people use for R is RStudio 
- Can be confusing bc RStudio the IDE comes from Rstudio (the company) 
- Going to go over to RStudio
- Then here to download
- Launch it now! 

## RStudio IDE 

* It's a GUI for all things R 
* When launch typically have four panels 
* if not and is three, click here
* Top left is script editor
* Bottom left is console
* top right is environment and few other things
* Bottom right is viewer panel and other things
* You can customize this and color (prefs) 

## Getting comfortable

* can type basic things into R
* Try to type addition in console
* Now you know that DS workflow is typically more involved than typing in and dont want to run code
* Try to do keyboard shortcut to write in editor and run command 
* Notice shoots down
* Let's try this again now to assign object
* notice when run you get something in global environment 
* Can manipulate that just like in python
* But we want to do data
* So let's use r's c() opertor to make whats called a vector
* Compared to Python, first major difference of vectorzation
* Because for statiticians, numbers is what typically goes in 
* There are things like lists in R, but beyond scope of intro now
* what happens if we add or multiply vector
* All at once, no numpy needed! 

* This data structure will be a bit more compicated (do I go here to dataframe and $ ?)
* See hands on programming with R if you want this or r for data science 

* Install tidvyverse 


## Running a Script

* Now won't go too much into script 
* but now open up this tips script
* Imagine we are in a class and all goign to america with intrernational 
* Need to elarna bout tips 
* Now note that this is nto just base R, going to run tidyverse 
* can Click run and it goes
