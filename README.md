## Base R 


There is no online thing for R, need to run this on computer.
Luckly this is much easier to do with R than Python. 

Note you want to follow these steps!
Just because you have RStudio from conda, not going to always work.
Best to just do clean install. 

- R is programming language that just had its 20th birthday
- Currenlty on 4.0
- Grows quickly and most of it lives on CRAN
- Go to cran to get it 
- Follow on screen instructions to get package
- Mac will do the rest
- Once it's done, can verify it's on computer by going to command line
- type R
- but doing it like this is insane 
- so either x out of termanal or quit() then don't save workspace

## RStudio

- Many IDEs (define) are avalible for all coding
- The one that most people use for R is RStudio 
- Can be confusing bc RStudio the IDE comes from Rstudio (the company) 
- Going to go over to RStudio
- Then here to download
- Launch it now! 

## RStudio IDE 

* It's a GUI for all things R 
* When launch typically have four panels 
* if not and is three, click here
* Top left is script editor
* Bottom left is console
* top right is environment and few other things
* Bottom right is viewer panel and other things
* You can customize this and color (prefs) 

* Get packages with install (try this)
